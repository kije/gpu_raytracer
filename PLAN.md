- implement per-color-channel raytracing to get chromatic aberration & rainbows
- Let the compute shader process a single color chanel at a time, and then have a separate pass to combine all channels into an rgb pixel per ray. This means each compute shader carries a rgb value and does any color calculation as well as refraction & absorption based on that color, for which we have some mapping to a wavelength
- implement caustics with photon mapping (separate compute pass?)
- in shared crate, can we use glam structs (Vec3 etc..) instead of arrays? Glam supports bytemuck)
- threading to avoid sluggish ui
- multiple compute passes, e.g. first pass to just calculate 
- Microfacet BRDF
- Add a way to save the scene as an image
- Add a way to load a saved scene from file
- reduce size of shared/transfered structs so we can utilize the gpu more efficently. Packing fields together etc...
